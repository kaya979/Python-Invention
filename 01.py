# DECISION MAKING IN PYTHON
# Decisions are made with 3  
# IF 
# IF-ELSE
# ELIF
# A program can use these to make decisions
# So the program starts from line 1 till the end and follows commands to do. 
# And also which roads to take.

# An if statement can be used to check if a condition is true or false.
# If the condition evaluates to true, then the code block following the if-statement is evaluated
