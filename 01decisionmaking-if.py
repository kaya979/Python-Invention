#      DECISION MAKING IN PYTHON   IF   #
#########################################
# Decisions are made with 3 statements
#   
# IF 
# IF-ELSE
# ELIF
# A program can use these to make decisions
# So the program starts from line 1 till the end and follows commands to do. 
# And also which roads to take.


# *****      IF     ******
# An if statement can be used to check if a condition is true or false.
# If the condition evaluates to true, then the code block following the if-statement is evaluated
# use INDENTATIONS for the code block (tab)
# e.g: 
#
#  if condition: 
#    statements if true
#

#
if 5 == 5: 
    print(" You have succesfully learned if statement")


#  == the 'equal to'  operator is used to comprare 2 entities as false or true

if 5 > 9: 
    print(" Oops not this time!")
if 5 >3:
    print("Yes this will work")
