# Python-Invention
Python basics. 

My opinion; learn the basics by making simple programs.
For a long time I could not understand the concept of while and for loops and if and else decisions and lists.
But by making a grocerie list I understand now the idea that we need something like a list, and to add continuously a new ingredient or item, we need to add a while loop. And to make the while loop stop we need to make a decision with the 'if' statement. 
Thus with these simple understanding, now Python makes sense.


Another advice firstly to myself, write on paper which steps need to be done. If I can explain to myself the steps needed for a program/algorithm to work, I can better conceptualize this in a program. 

Thinking in a programming way needs daily exercise. The groceries list is something I tried to rehearse from memory: 
            Step 1; define a list
            Step 2; start a loop
            Step 3; decide to continue or stop
            Step 4; if continue add item, if stop print list.
